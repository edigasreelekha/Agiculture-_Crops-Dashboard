 ## Agriculture Data Analysis and Dashboard
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on agriculture, utilizing data sourced from Kaggle. The project involves data cleaning and transformation using Excel and Power Query, followed by the creation of interactive dashboards in Power BI for insightful visualizations.

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze agricultural data to identify trends, patterns, and key insights that can be beneficial for understanding agricultural dynamics. The process involved:

* *Data Acquisition:* Obtaining raw agricultural data from Kaggle.

* *Data Cleaning & Transformation:* Utilizing Excel and Power Query within Power BI for robust data cleaning, shaping, and transformation.

* *Data Modeling & Analysis:* Performing analysis within Power BI's Power Query editor.

* *Interactive Dashboard Creation:* Developing visually appealing and interactive dashboards in Power BI to present the findings.

## Technologies Used
* *Data Source:* Kaggle
* *Data Cleaning & Transformation:* Microsoft Excel, Power Query (within Power BI)
* *Data Visualization & Dashboarding:* Microsoft Power BI Desktop

## Dashboard Highlights 
The Power BI dashboards provide insights into:

!(Overall Crop Production & Trends)[https://github.com/edigasreelekha/Agiculture-_Crops-Dashboard/blob/main/OVERVIEW%20(2).png]

* Rice and Wheat are the dominant crops, with total production significantly higher than Groundnuts and Cotton, indicating their primary role in the agricultural output.
* Kharif and Rabi production show overall growth trends over several decades, highlighting long-term expansion in these seasonal cultivations.

 !(Rice Production Deep Dive)[https://github.com/edigasreelekha/Agiculture-_Crops-Dashboard/blob/main/Rice.png]

* West Bengal is the leading state in Rice Production and Land Area, while Punjab contributes the largest share of Rice Yield, showcasing regional specializations.
* Both Rice Production and the Area dedicated to rice cultivation have seen consistent growth from 1960 to 2010, indicating sustained expansion in rice farming.

!(Wheat Production Deep Dive)[https://github.com/edigasreelekha/Agiculture-_Crops-Dashboard/blob/main/Wheat.png]
* Punjab is the overwhelming leader in both Wheat Yield and overall Wheat Production and Area, emphasizing its critical role as the "breadbasket" for wheat.
* Wheat Production and Land Area show a strong, consistent upward trend over the decades, similar to rice, signifying a robust and expanding wheat sector.

!(Groundnuts Production Deep Dive)[https://github.com/edigasreelekha/Agiculture-_Crops-Dashboard/blob/]

* Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are the primary states for Groundnuts Production and Area, while Tamil Nadu leads in Groundnuts Yield.
* Groundnuts production shows more volatility over time compared to rice and wheat, with a peak around 1990 followed by fluctuations, suggesting less stable growth.

!(Cotton Production Deep Dive)[https://github.com/edigasreelekha/Agiculture-_Crops-Dashboard/blob/main/Cotton.png]

* Gujarat and Haryana dominate in Cotton Production and Area, indicating these are the key regions for cotton cultivation.
* Cotton production has increased over time, while the area has grown at a slower rate, implying improvements in yield per unit area due to better farming practices or varieties.

## Future Enhancements

* Integrating more diverse datasets (e.g., soil data, temperature data).
* Implementing advanced analytics or machine learning models.
* Publishing the dashboard to Power BI Service for wider accessibility.
